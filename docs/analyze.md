## Fitabase

After the cleaning process, I started analyzing the data. The data analyzed is limited and not a good representation of our target customers. However, we can try to identify overall trends that can be extrapolate to our case.
I started with the daily activity, and this are my findings:
  * There is a clear correlation between `TotalSteps` and the different distances (`TotalDistance`, `TrackerDistance`, `LoggedActivitiesDistance`, `VeryActiveDistance`, `ModeratelyActiveDistance`, `LightActiveDistance`) which is not surprising.
  * There is no clear correlation between `TotalSteps` or `TotalDistance` and `Calories`.
  * Then, I looked at the quantities based on the day of the week, this is what I found:
    * It is not statistically significant because of the dataset, but there is a trend on `TotalSteps` and `TotalDistance` to be lower on Sundays and Mondays. After further analysis, it looks like it is just because the data has 3 Sundays and Mondays, and 4 of the other days. After weighting the quantities properly, the trend disappear.
    * After normalizing all the quantities to the proper day, there is no clear trend in any quantity based on the day of the week. Perhaps the only noticeable, but not statistically significant, difference is in the `SedentaryActiveDistance`, where it seems that Monday and Thursdays have higher values.
  * I try to categorize the information of the individuals based on their "active level". I use a definition of active level based on [this website](https://www.medicinenet.com/how_many_steps_a_day_is_considered_active/article.htm). Where individuals are categorize in 5 different levels based on the number of daily steps:
     * `TotalSteps < 5000` is  'Sedentary'
     * `TotalSteps) < 7500` is 'Low Active'
     * `TotalSteps) < 10000` is 'Somewhat Active'
     * `TotalSteps) < 12500` is 'Active'
     * `TotalSteps) > 12500`, is 'Highly Active'
    The information is limited but there are some interesting observations that we can point out to the stakeholders:
      * The number of minutes of activity does not linearly scale to the active level.
      * Same for distance.
      * Very active people makes the most steps on Saturdays, while sedentary people make the least on Sundays.
      * Although calories and steps are in general correlated, active (and highly active) people have many days with low calorie count.  
  * Then, I looked at the `sleepDay` dataset. There are only 15 participants with data. No clear trend in the data is found.
  * Then I looked at correlations between the daily activity and sleep. I merged `dailyActivity` and `sleepDay` tables. After removing `Nan` values I ended up with similar number of participants as the `sleepDay` (as excepted). I found:
    * There is a negative correlation between `TotalMinutesAsleep` and `SendentaryMinutes`.
    * There is a mildly negative correlation between `FairlyActiveMinutes` and `TotalMinutesAsleep`.
  * Then I looked into the hourly dataset. I found:
    * The data is not very significant but overall it seems that most of the participants have more of their daily steps every day around 12:00 and 19:00.
    * The patterns are similar for weekdays and slightly different for weekends. Participants are more active at 13:00 on Saturdays, and less active than usual after 19:00 on Sundays.
    * Similar patterns from the daily steps is found in calories and intensity.
  * I analyze the `minuteSleep` dataset. No major pattern found.


## AppleFitbitData

After the cleaning and deciding to use only the Apple Watch dataset. This is what I found:
 * There are 49 participants (26 women and 23 men).
 * The majority of the participants have less than 35 years old. The average of weight-height for woman is 160cm-60kg, and men is 180cm-75kg.
 * After this, I looked into the different activities logged in the dataset: Lying, Sitting, Self-paced walk, Running 3 METs, Running 5 METs, Running 7 METs. These activities were compared between women and men. This is what I found:
  * Although there is small difference in the distributions of heart rate for Lying, Sitting and Self-paced walk, mayor differences start to appear for the Running activities. This is a nice result that needs further studies.
  * There is a difference between male/female for the calories expended in the different activities.
  * There is a clear difference in the resting heart rate between men/women in all the activities.
  * The intensity is also different between male/female following the trend seen for heart rate.
  * I tried to go deeper into these discrepancies:
    * Checking the correlation of variables per gender, there is no clear difference there.
    * I investigate about the effect of age in those variables, I see that the differences could appear for participants in different age ranges.
    * I concentrate in participants age 15-35, and the discrepancies are still there. However, by looking only at participants above 35 years old, these discrepancies are not significant.
  * From this quick test, and acknowledging the limitations of the dataset, I think I can use this discrepancies for the final presentation.


## FitbitsAndGradesData

After the cleaning, this is what I found:
 * Looking at the average of the quantities, there is no statistically significant difference in any of the features between genders.
 * Looking at the correlation between features, the data shows correlations:
    * between the heart-rate at minutes at peak and cardio,
    * at cardio and fat-burn,
    * (a little) between steps and fatburn,
    * (a little) negative between minutes active and steps,
    * negative correlation between minutes and mode,
    * gender and minutes active,
    * GPA and steps (surprising)
    * life score and minutes active.
  Going deep into the women data only, the previous correlations holds, having an increased correlation between cardio and peak, and fat-burn and peak. The negative correlation between minutes, GPA and steps also significantly increased.
  * Then, I compared life score vs GPA for steps, HR peak, HR cardio, HR fatburn. I am not taking into account the unhealthy and very healthy Life Scores due to the lack of data. I found:
    * For healthy or average participants, the GPA increases with the number of steps. The trend is more significant in females.
    * For male participants, there is a clear pattern for avg minutes in the peak zone compare to healthy and average life scores. This trend is not there for females.
    * There is no really a trend for cardio and fat-burn zones with respect to GPA or life scores.
