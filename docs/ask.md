### What is the problem I am trying to solve?

Bellabeat is an established company focused on health smart products for women. The problem that I am trying to solve is the main trends in smart device usage found in Bellabeat's competitors' data that can be applied to Bellabeat customers to influence their marketing strategy.

### How can my insights drive business decisions?

If some trends are found in the data from Bellabeat's competitors, we can implement better marketing strategies to target new customers.

### Consider key stakeholders

The primary stakeholders are Urska and Sando from the managing team and the Bellabeat marketing team. My presentation and findings must be directed to them.

### Identify the business task

The task is to find possible trends in the behavior or usage of smart devices of thirty Fitbit users, using the data collected in December 2016, that can be replicated and overcome with the Bellabeat products to improve marketing strategies.
