### Results and recommendations

The outcomes of this study are:
  * highly active people can use Bellabeat’s Time and Leaf to track their activities, heart rate, and sleep patterns. This study suggested that highly active people have different activity patterns than more sedentary people. If advertising is targeted to these groups, it should be used on different days.
  * In terms of sleeping patterns, the marketing department can be focused on showing users that tracking sleeping states with Bellabeat’s Time and Leaf can let users know when they are sleeping less.
  * This study shows that women and men have different health metrics, and even some indications being active can improve women's intellectual activities. This can be used explicitly for Bellabeat to show their customers the value of a women-focused company.
  * The data used in this analysis can be further utilized to predict activity levels. This step is covered in the Data Science part of the portfolio.
